\label{sec:conclusion}

We study the load balance problem in a distributed storage system that employs
two well-developed technologies namely deduplication and erasure coding.  We
point out that deduplication inherently cannot maintain read balance as the
deduplicated chunks are unevenly distributed across nodes.  We formulate a
combinatorial optimization problem, and propose the 
{\em Even Data Placement (EDP) algorithm}, a polynomial-time greedy algorithm
that minimizes the read balance gap subject to the storage balance constraint.
We further extend the EDP algorithm for heterogeneous environments.  Extensive
trace-driven simulations and testbed experiments show that EDP improves read
performance and preserves storage balance.  In addition to storage efficiency
and data availability respectively provided by deduplication and erasure
coding, our work further enhances the parallel I/O performance of a
distributed storage system through the design of a load-balance data placement
scheme.
