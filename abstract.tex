Modern distributed storage systems aggregate multiple storage nodes to provide
scalable platforms for managing a tremendous amount of data.  They often
deploy deduplication to remove content-level redundancy to improve storage
efficiency, and use erasure coding to introduce node-level redundancy to
provide fault tolerance guarantees.  However, deduplication inevitably leads
to unbalanced data placement, thereby degrading read performance.  In this
paper, we study the load balance problem in distributed storage systems that
deploy deduplication and erasure coding, and argue that it is generally
challenging to find a data placement that simultaneously achieves both read
balance and write balance objectives.  To this end, we formulate a
combinatorial optimization problem, and propose a greedy, polynomial-time
{\em Even Data Placement (EDP)} algorithm, which identifies a data placement
that effectively achieves read balance while maintaining write balance.  We
further extend our EDP algorithm to heterogeneous environments.  We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our EDP algorithm under real-world workloads
using both extensive simulations and prototype testbed experiments.  In
particular, our testbed experiments show that our EDP algorithm reduces the
file read time by 37.41\% compared to the baseline round-robin placement, and
the reduction can further reach 52.11\% in a heterogeneous setting.
